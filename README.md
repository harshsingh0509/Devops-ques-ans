Suppose you are managing a system with MongoDB, MySQL, and APIs, and one API faces high latency, degrading performance. How would you identify the issue, diagnose the root cause, and resolve it?

Explanation- Firstly I will monitor logs and metrics by using Elastic Stack or Prometheus to identify latency issues. Then will trace the requests from frontend to backend to check for slow databases queries or inefficient code. Will optimize the code change queries using caching to ensure proper load balancing. Then will review API Gateway settings to adjust timeout thresholds and optimize routing rules and this will automatically reduce latency and will improve performance.
